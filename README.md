🚀 Pattern Generator & Number Analyzer

A menu-driven Python console application that allows users to:


⭐ Generate star patterns

🔢 Analyze numbers within a range

➕ Calculate the sum of numbers

❌ Exit safely


This project demonstrates fundamental Python concepts including loops, conditionals, and the modern match-case statement.


📌 Project Overview

This application provides two main functionalities:

1️⃣ Pattern Generator

Generates a right-angled triangle star pattern

User defines number of rows

Uses nested loops for pattern logic



2️⃣ Number Analyzer

Accepts a starting and ending range

Identifies numbers as Even or Odd

Calculates total sum of numbers

Validates range condition (start should not be greater than end)



🧠 Concepts Used

while loop (menu-driven program)

match-case (Python 3.10 switch statement)

Nested for loops

Conditional statements

Modulo operator (%)

Range iteration

Basic input validation

🛠 Technologies

Python 3.10+
